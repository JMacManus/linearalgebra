# Linear Algebra
Some linear algebra work done in Haskell.

Main project is smith.hs and smith.exe. The idea is to take in input 

    smith [[1,2],[3,4]]

and output the smith normal-form of such a matrix.

There is a smith.exe program in the \out folder. Place that somewhere and from the cmd, cd to it's location and run commands of the above form to start converting your matrices.

### TODO
- refactor code into a more standard project layout
- maybe use SMF to implement some kind of crazy group counter.
- Redo matrixparser.hs to be both more general and less wonky.
