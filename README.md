# Linear Algebra
Some linear algebra work done in Haskell.

Main project is smith.hs and smith.exe. The idea is to take in input 

>>> smith [[1,2],[3,4]]

and output the smith normal-form of such a matrix.

#TODO
- refactor code into a more standard project layout
- maybe use SMF to implement some kind of crazy group counter.
