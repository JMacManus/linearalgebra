# Linear Algebra
Some linear algebra work done in Haskell.

linalg.hs is a Haskell module extending Data.Matrix with features like Smith normal-form and Gaussian elimination.

matrices.hs is an experiment to remove dependency on Data.Matrix.



#TODO
- create working executables using the module(s).
- maybe use SMF to implement some kind of crazy group counter.
- finish working on matrixparser.hs
